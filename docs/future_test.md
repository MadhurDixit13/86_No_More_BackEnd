# Automated Testing Best Practices for future

In our GitHub repository, it's crucial to implement effective strategies for testing, especially when working with APIs and databases. Here are some recommended approaches to ensure robust and reliable testing that can be used for future work:

## 1. **Separate Test Database**

Create a dedicated database for testing purposes. This prevents interference with the main database, allowing tests to run without affecting production data.

## 2. **Mocking or Stubbing**

Simulate the behavior of components (e.g., databases) without actual interaction. Utilize libraries like Sinon.js to create mock versions for testing.

## 3. **Database Transactions**

Begin a transaction at the test's start and roll it back at the end. This ensures that any changes made during the test are discarded, maintaining the database's original state.

## 4. **Clearing Database Data**

Before running a test suite, clear relevant data from the database. Be cautious with this approach, as it may be slow and impractical with large datasets.

## 5. **Fixture Data**

Load predefined fixture data into the database prior to testing. This guarantees a known starting state for tests.

## 6. **Environment Variables**

Use environment variables to configure the application differently during tests. For instance, connect to a separate test database using specific environment settings.

## 7. **Unique Identifiers**

Employ unique identifiers or timestamps when creating data to prevent conflicts and ensure data distinctiveness.

## 8. **Teardown Scripts**

Write scripts to clean up any data generated during testing. This could be part of the testing framework setup or a separate script run after testing.

## 9. **Isolate Tests**

Ensure tests are independent of each other. Each test should not rely on the state left by previous tests, enhancing reliability and ease of debugging.

By adhering to these testing best practices, we can maintain a high level of code quality, minimize potential issues, and confidently deploy our applications.
